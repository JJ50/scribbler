Good: 
1. Daily word inputting possible (similar to the CS50 finance/ thread-like wrdly)-Irma by fri
2. Table of content: buttons for each month: if mouse clicks button, then will switch to a page that lists the dates in the month
3. User could choose color outlining their daily journal entry	
4. Program can calculate word frequency (inspirations from Pset 6)-irma
5. User can choose their mood of the day-joy

Better:
6. User could add 1 picture per entry
7. Public/private settings of the entries

Best (only when there is extra time left before deadline):
8. Graphic tree where each entry is a leaf and the color will be the “fill” color of the leaves on the branch

9. Exchange of “leaves” between users
